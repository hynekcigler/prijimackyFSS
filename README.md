This is a source code of the Shiny application (http://shiny.rstudio.com/), which simulates the properties of admission test to the Faculty of Social Studies at Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic. It combines two scores from three different tests. Some of them can be taken more times and the best attempt is taken into the account.

The application itself can be found at http://fssvm6.fss.muni.cz/prijimZk/.
